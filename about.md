With a background in linguistics, I am passionate about languages. I love both natural and programming languages. As an undergrad, I studied Italian, French, Spanish, and Arabic. Now as a programmer I have studied C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. I am also interested in Python and AngularJS.

In my second life, I am a wife and mother of two beautiful girls. I love spending time with my family, playing games and eating good food. I have a growing interest in photography. I also love DIY projects- I recently refinished an old dresser and my kitchen table.
