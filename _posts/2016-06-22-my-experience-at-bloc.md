title: My Experience at Bloc
---
The year-long Software Engineering track at Bloc is somewhat of a crossover between a traditional coding bootcamp and a 4-year university degree. It is divided into four sections: Rails Web Development, Frontend Web Development,, Software Engineering Principles, and an Open Source Apprenticeship.

As I have progressed through the program, it has been both challenging and satisfying. I have now completed the first section of the program that has covered almost exclusively Ruby on Rails. Through MVC architecture, I have learned how to build an application from the ground up. I love the empowerment I have felt from learning how to create a web application out of nothing. I have gained valuable skills in version control through [GitHub](https://github.com/), collaboration tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/), and the power of the Ruby language, employing gems and other applications such as Devise and Stripe to enhance my applications.

Bloc itself has been so well outlined and structured that I have been learning so much and gaining new skills almost without evening realizing it. As I am presented with new assignments, it is my personality to just dive right in and try to wrestle out a solution. Because of how well Bloc is structured, I don’t feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the challenge given.

>“It's interesting how we often can't see the ways in which we are being strong - like, you can't be aware of what you're doing that's tough and brave at the time that you're doing it because if you knew that it was brave, then you'd be scared.”
-Lena Dunham

There have definitely been setbacks for me, as well as moments of discouragement. However, Bloc has implemented a mentorship program that has made a huge difference in how I let those setbacks affect me. Meeting with a mentor on a regular basis has helped keep me from getting and staying discouraged. It has boosted my confidence and helped me gain even more insight into the skills I am developing.

Though I am only a fraction of the way through Bloc’s curriculum, it has been an extremely positive experience for me. I can’t wait for the next sections and I am looking forward to all of the skills and knowledge I will gain as I move forward and complete the program.
